<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Hello World app shows you how to use the LCD display on the eMote.NOW. It 
scrolls the string "Hello World&nbsp; " across the 4-character display. You can 
use the App to modify the message, change the scrolling rate, etc.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>eMote.NOW 1.0, TinyCLR version 4.3.1.0</p>
<h2>Complexity Level</h2>
<p>Introductory. The code is simple and easy to follow. Good for beginning 
users.</p>
    <h2>Compiling</h2>
    <p>When you compile the App the first time you will probably get one or more assembly reference errors for the Samraksh DLLs. That will be because you have them in a different location than we used when we created the App. All you have to do is delete the existing references and recreate them by browsing to where you&#39;ve stored the DLLs.</p>
