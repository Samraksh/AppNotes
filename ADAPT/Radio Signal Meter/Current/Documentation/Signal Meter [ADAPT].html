<h2>Description</h2>
<p>eMote for ADAPT comes with radio networking capabilities built in. This app 
note shows you how to listen for radio traffic and determine information about 
sender, signal strength, etc.</p>
<h2>Compatability</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:#17365D">ADAPT Core Hardware v 1.04</span>, <span style="color:#17365D">eMote release v 1.01<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<h2>Complexity Level</h2>
<p>Fairly introductory. There is some complexity with respect to radio setup.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>You'll need two or more ADAPT platforms, each with a
<a href="https://samraksh.com/products/small-battery-powered-computers/31-product-pages/product-small-battery-powered-computers/60-emote-now">
Samraksh Long-Range Radio</a> and a Samraksh Shim Adapter. Connect the Shim 
Adapter to the ADAPT platform as follows. First, solder a wire to each of the 
Shim Board solder terminals mentioned in the table below.</p>

<p>This app note assumes that you're using the ADAPT Dev board which has LEDs 
associated with several GPIO pins. These are used to give some on-board status 
information and are optional. See the Controlled Blink app note for information 
on how to connect LEDs.</p>
<h2>Running the Program</h2>
<p>Use the ADAPT eMote User's Guide for details on running programs. </p>
<p>Compile the program. Deploy it on each ADAPT platform by turn. Setup console 
monitors, one for each ADAPT platform. Start the program on each platform. You 
can see output on the monitors.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind this app note is pretty simple. Both motes are running 
the same program. Each one periodically sends a broadcast message. When it 
receives a message, it prints information about the sender, signal strength, 
etc. on the debug log.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app note includes a SimpleCsmaRadio class that is used to configure the 
radio. It specifies the kind of radio (long-range, in this case), the CCA sense 
time, the transmit power, and a method to call when data is received. In the 
constructor call from Main, the CCA sense time and transmit power are set to 
typical values but you can change them if you'd like. The RadioReceive method 
gets the first message from the first packet and prints the details to the 
console. </p>
